APCS Sortings

# Setup
Autogenerates numbers. Simply run the .java file to run sorting algorithms.

# Selection Sort
Sorting algorithm that simply compares 2 values and switches the #s

# Merge Sort
Recursively sorts numbers in an array.
Takes in entire vector, but will merge the following sections
together:  Left sublist from a[first]..a[mid], right sublist from
a[mid+1]..a[last].

# Quick Sort
QuickSort puts elements of a list in a certain order.

# Bubble Sort
Sorting Algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted,
compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in
the wrong order.

# Insertion Sort
This algorithm builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time
